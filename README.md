# Drawing Coach - Ready to Deploy

This is a simple React web app (create-react-app compatible) that:
- Allows uploading a photo (client-side).
- Generates on-device overlays: grid, edge contour, tonal posterization, construction ellipse.
- Lets the user download the composite canvas for each step.

How to deploy to Vercel:
1. Unzip and `cd` into the project folder.
2. Create a GitHub repo and push this project, OR drag the folder into Vercel's "Import Project" UI.
3. Vercel will detect React and deploy automatically. You'll get a live link.

Notes:
- No server required â€” everything is client-side.
- For best results upload a clear, front-lit selfie.
